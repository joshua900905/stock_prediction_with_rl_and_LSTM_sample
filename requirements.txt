# requirements.txt

# Core numerical and data handling library
numpy>=1.19.0

# Library for making HTTP requests to APIs
requests>=2.25.0,<3.0.0

# Scikit-learn for data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler) and potentially other ML tools
scikit-learn>=0.24.0 # Older versions might work, but >=0.24 is safer for recent features

# Joblib for saving/loading Python objects efficiently (like the Scaler)
joblib>=1.0.0,<2.0.0

# Deep Learning Framework (Choose one - TensorFlow includes Keras)
# Option 1: TensorFlow (Recommended - includes Keras)
# Specify CPU or GPU version if needed, e.g., tensorflow-gpu
tensorflow>=2.4.0
# Specify a range compatible with your hardware/CUDA if using GPU

# Option 2: Standalone Keras (Less common now, usually used with TF backend)
# If you use this, you might also need to install a backend like tensorflow explicitly
# keras>=2.4.0,<2.12.0

# Optional: For reading configurations or advanced file handling (though not explicitly used in the provided snippets)
# python-dotenv>=0.15.0 # If you use .env files for credentials
# pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0 # If you decide to use DataFrames for data manipulation
